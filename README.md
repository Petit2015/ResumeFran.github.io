	Hello Everyone! My name is Frandeline Petit. I am a registered nurse for almost three years now. Currently I have an interest in the computer science and plan on pursuing it. Although I know nothing about the field, I am extremely excited about submerging myself into it. <Br>  I know it won't be easy to learn but I know I am up for the challenge. I can't wait to see what I am capable of creating.
